# Decentralized Resource Gateway

A Flask-based web application that serves as a decentralized resource gateway. This project leverages Flask, SQLAlchemy, and other Python libraries to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing resources in a decentralized manner.

---

## Features

- User authentication and session management using `flask-login`.
- Secure form handling with `flask-wtf` and `wtforms`.
- Database integration with `flask-sqlalchemy` and PostgreSQL.
- Email validation using `email-validator`.
- Production-ready deployment with `gunicorn`.
- Modular and scalable architecture.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- PostgreSQL database
- A terminal or command-line interface

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd DecentralizedResourceGateway

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)

4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the following:

FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>/<database_name>
SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>

5. Initialize the Database
If the project uses database migrations, apply them:
flask db upgrade

6. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server:

flask run

The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Running in Production
For production, use gunicorn to serve the application:

gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
